Description:

	A WPF project to realize a user interface for the DiReCT program based on the mock-up of Johnson Su.
	
	Using C# .NET and WPF, the current version is under MVVM. While an older, more MVC version is also available as zip file. 

	A code sample from MSDN is used in the project, related license can be found in the folder.
	
Future works in order of decreasing importance:
	
	Future to-dos:
	
		Implementation of ObservationRecord and other models.
		Internet transmission and its security.
		Real-time validation module.
	
	Possible major improvements:
	
		Multi-threading on time-consuming works such as XML parsing and record validation.
		Implementation of new maps using GMAP.	
		Simplify the logic by using Stateless or other state machine models.
	
	Possible works in the future:
	
		Rework of the hard-coded grids with DataGrids.
		Work on 'background', 'task list' and 'recorder', depending on future versions of the mock-up.
